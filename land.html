<p class="text">HM Land Registry began a phased release of its data on property transactions—the Price Paid Dataset—in March 2012, and by November 2013 the entire historic record dating back to 1995 was released. The data provides much-needed transparency in a historically “murky” business, and is already being used extensively by some traditional players in the property market. Additionally, new players are consolidating around the field of proptech, developing digital tools to bring buying and selling property “out of the Stone Age”. Proptech startups attracted an estimated $1.4 billion in investment globally in 2014. PI Labs, an incubator for proptech startups, opened in London in late 2014.</p>

<p class="text">HM Land Registry (HMLR) was created in 1862 to register the ownership of land and property in England and Wales. It is responsible for maintaining the Land Register, where more than 24 million titles (evidence of land and property ownership) are documented. </p>
<p class="text">In 1993 it was established as a trading fund—a type of government agency that has the authority (under the Government Trading funds Act 1973) to meet its outgoing costs from the money it charges for services. Other trading funds include Companies House, The Met Office and Ordnance Survey (OS). HMLR’s receipts come mainly from fees it charges individuals and organisations to register land, and to register changes in title to land and properties.</p>
<p class="text">The Land Register is the world’s largest property database<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-057-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-057">1</a></span></span>. At the height of the UK property boom in 2007, it processed around £1 million worth of property every minute in England and Wales<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-056-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-056">2</a></span></span>. However, the credit crunch saw a slowdown in the UK market. HMLR lost £220m over three years to January 2011 and was forced to increase fees to users by 30%<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-055-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-055">3</a></span></span>. Those fees have since decreased, as part of HM Land Registry’s strategy to encourage more people to register transactions online.</p>
<p class="text">The trading fund model has played a controversial role in the UK’s journey to open data, since at least in the cases where agencies are funded by receipts from reselling data (for example OS) the two approaches are in conflict. Indeed, a previous study by the author of the UK’s journey to open data, records “strong resistance” from trading funds and in particular OS, to a future of open government data:</p>
<p class="e-quote">The Power of Information Review had recommended a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the <span class="CharOverride-3">Trading fund</span> model, which was commissioned jointly by <span class="CharOverride-3">HM Treasury</span> and the then Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, and published in February 2008. Despite that study finding strongly in favour of abandoning the <span class="CharOverride-3">Trading fund</span> model, and despite the Power of Information Taskforce recommending reform on the back of its findings, positions against re-examining the <span class="CharOverride-3">Trading fund</span> model within government remained entrenched.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-054-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-054">4</a></span></span></p>
<p class="text">In November 2010, the government announced plans to create a Public Data Corporation (PDC) to coordinate the release of data from the trading funds that deal in data and information (OS, The Met Office, Companies House, and HMLR). The plans represented “a wholesale reorganisation of the largest trading funds”, but did not go into detail on how much of the data released by the PDC would be open, and also included the possibility of the PDC being part-privatised<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-053-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-053">5</a></span></span>.</p>
<p class="text">In August 2011, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) consulted with the public on the PDC’s data policy<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-052-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-052">6</a></span></span>. In November 2011, Chancellor George Osborne made commitments on open data in his Autumn Statement that included data releases from Companies House, HMLR, and The Met Office, a limited data release from OS, and the establishment of a Public Data Group to share best practice that would supersede the PDC<span class="CharOverride-4"><span id="footnote-051-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-051">7</a></span></span>. In March 2012 BIS published a response that included terms of reference for a Data Strategy Board that would “seek to maximise the value of data from the Public Data Group … for long-term economic and social benefit, including through the release of data free of charge”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-050-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-050">8</a></span></span>. </p>
<p class="text">In July 2014 the UK’s coalition government abandoned plans to privatise or part-privatise HMLR, after Liberal Democrat business secretary Vince Cable blocked the move<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-049-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-049">9</a></span></span>. However, after the May 2015 elections returned a majority Conservative government privatisation may be back on the table: Chancellor George Osborne has outlined plans to privatise £23bn worth of government assets as an attempt to bolster public finances<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-048-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-048">10</a></span></span>, and campaigners against privatisation identify HMLR as one of the targets<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-047-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-047">11</a></span></span>.</p>
<p class="text">In April 2015, the functions of the Public Data Group were integrated into a new BIS-run board, the Digital Culture, Services Platforms, and Data Board, and the PDG met for the last time<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-046-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-046">12</a></span></span>.</p>

<p class="text">HMLR’s Price Paid Dataset contains over 20 million transactions going back to 1995 for residential properties sold for full market value. It was this dataset that Chancellor George Osborne committed the Land Registry to releasing as open data in his 2011 Autumn Statement. In March 2012, HMLR began releasing monthly files of transactions. 2013 saw the release of historic data in two phases: Records of transactions between 2009 and 2012 were released in June 2013; and in November 2013 the full historical record from January 1995 to the current month was released. That year also saw the release of the price paid database as linked data. In 2014, HMLR worked with a third-party supplier to create an “easy to use” front end, the Price Paid Data Report Builder tool<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-045-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-045">13</a></span></span>.</p>
<p class="text">The data is not a full picture of land ownership in England and Wales—it only includes details of properties bought and sold between January 1995 and the present (see box on page 32). It is released under an Open Government Licence and as such it conforms with the open definition. It is updated every month with the new transactions that have been recorded, and corrections to older entries. </p>
<p class="text">The quality—and timeliness—of the data relies in part on those people (homeowners and their solicitors) who register it with HMLR. A sample monthly update file showed approximately 2,500 entries against transactions older than a year, which might be assumed to be corrections to existing transactions. Of the (roughly) remaining 79,000 transactions assumed to be new transactions, 3,345 (4.2%) were more than six months old.</p>
<p class="text">Before its release as open data, Price Paid data had been made available in bulk to paying customers as part of HMLR’s commercial activities. As such, HMLR had sought the view of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in 2004 as to whether Price Paid data (which includes addresses) constituted biographical information, and the ICO had indicated that it did not. Before its release in 2012, HMLR carried out a Privacy Impact Assessment<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-044-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-044">14</a></span></span>, and reviewed the assessment again in 2013<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-043-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-043">15</a></span></span>. Both reviews concluded that Price Paid data was deemed not to be biographical or personal in nature. The pre-release review flagged an increase in companies using the data for direct marketing purposes as a potential issue; the 2013 review concluded that there had been no increase in direct marketing as a result of the release.</p>

<p class="e-h2"><a id="_idTextAnchor000"></a>Box: What is in HM Land Registry’s Price Paid dataset, and what isn’t</p>
<p class="text">HM Land Registry’s Price Paid Dataset, the subject of this study, is a subset of the information HM Land Registry holds on land and property ownership in England &amp; Wales. The over 20 million transactions in the current version of the dataset appear to relate to 11,738,465 unique addresses<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-042-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-042">16</a></span></span>. In total, the Land Register consists of 24 million titles. </p>
<p class="text">Even the Land Register itself is not a complete picture of land and property ownership in England &amp; Wales, since compulsory registration of land and property is only triggered by a property transaction of some kind. And although the Land Registry was created in 1862, compulsory registration across England &amp; Wales only arrived in the 1990s. Since then, notifying the Land Registry has been compulsory when land or property is bought or sold, and (more recently) when any mortgage is taken out on it, or when land or property is inherited. Some land and properties have remained in the same family or organisation’s ownership for generations, and have therefore never been registered. In July 2012, HM Land Registry announced that 80% of the land mass of England &amp; Wales was now registered<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-041-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-041">17</a></span></span>. </p>
<p class="text">The Price Paid Dataset is a subset of the information on the 80% of the land mass that HM Land Registry does hold (just under 50% of the titles it holds that in turn relate to 80% of the land mass of England &amp; Wales). The Price Paid Dataset also does not contain information on the individuals who own the title, or the title ID. The address, postcode, and transaction value is included, as well as some basic information about the property, such as whether it is a new build. Further information may be obtained for a fee of £3 per title. </p>
<p class="text">While it’s easy to understand why the Land Registry don’t include the registered owners of all the properties in the Price Paid Dataset, some of the dataset’s other exclusions are harder to understand. Price Paid only includes property transactions between individuals where property has been sold for full market value. It does not include any information (for example) that the Land Registry holds on properties that have been inherited, or on properties owned by corporations, or on land transactions. Land Registry does make available in bulk its data on land and property owned by corporations (excluding private individuals, overseas companies, charities, and trustees), but only to paying customers. This database consists of 3.2 million title records.</p>
<p class="text">In July 2015 David Cameron announced that HM Land Registry would release, as open data, data on property and land owned by corporate entities registered overseas, including the name and correspondence address of the legal owner of the company. This followed a series of reports from Private Eye magazine using similar data, obtained from the Land Registry under Freedom of Information laws. The data released to Private Eye consisted of details of 96,441 titles<span class="CharOverride-5"><span id="footnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-040">18</a></span></span>. </p>
<p class="text">Using this data, Private Eye were able to uncover a number of public interest stories, including the frequency with which property and investment companies use overseas corporate vehicles to own significant London landmarks, thereby achieving capital gains tax and stamp duty advantages.</p>
<p class="text">An interactive map that displays the data is available on the Private Eye website<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-039">19</a></span></span>. In order to build the map, Private Eye used a dataset of title plans released by HM Land Registry under the EU’s INSPIRE scheme—the INSPIRE index polygons. Although the INSPIRE index polygons are released by HMLR under the OGL, the dataset contains third-party intellectual property that belongs to Ordnance Survey (OS). HMLR states in its conditions of use<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-038">20</a></span></span> that this means anyone making the polygons available to third parties, or using them for anything other than “personal, non-commercial or commercial or non-commercial use within your organisation” needs to “contact Ordnance Survey for the relevant licence conditions”. Christian Eriksson, the freelance journalist who led the project on Land Registry data, says that neither he nor Private Eye<span class="CharOverride-3"> </span>contacted Ordnance Survey before publishing the interactive map, believing his use of the INSPIRE index polygons constitutes fair dealing under Section 30(2) of the Copyright Designs and Patent Act 1988<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-037">21</a></span></span>. </p>

<p class="text">Who was calling for HMLR Price Paid data to be released as open data? The fact that HMLR is a trading fund means it was a general target for open data enthusiasts. In responses to the government’s PDC consultation, HMLR data was rated as the third most requested dataset to be “free for use and reuse” after Ordnance Survey data and Address/Postcode information<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-036">22</a></span></span>. Lynne Nicholson, Head of Data Products and Services at HMLR, says the data release responded to “a general call for government to release more data<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-035">23</a></span></span>”, and did not mention any particular organisations who were calling for the data to be released, beyond the Open Data Institute, which in any case was only created at the same time as the announcement that the Price Paid Dataset was to be made available as open data.</p>
<p class="text">Data based on HM Land Registry data, including Property Sales<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-034">24</a></span></span> and Median House Prices<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-033">25</a></span></span> had been published intermittently on data.gov.uk by the Department for Communities and Local Government since 2010, and had fed into a small number of apps, notably the parking app JustPark. Before the open data release, HMLR Price Paid data had been available as downloadable .txt files (and also as bespoke reports) to a small group of organisations on a commercial basis. A business case for releasing the data, drafted before the Chancellor’s autumn Statement and released under FOI in February 2012, reveals that HMLR were attracting a modest £600,000 of income from this activity per year. It notes that:</p>
<p class="e-quote">Existing customers for this data are, in the main, companies that publish the data on their own websites. Land Registry has 30 existing subscribers who are website based businesses and 7 others which they class as consultant/research users. In a typical month they also receive ad hoc requests for specific areas and time periods of data from a small group of customers, most of which are Local Authorities—on average 5 requests a month. They also receive ad hoc requests from Estate agents and solicitors, usually 1-2 a month from each sector<span id="footnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-032">26</a></span>.</p>
<p class="text">During interview, HMLR did not wish to reveal the identities of its paying customers prior to the data release<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-031">27</a></span></span>. A source in the industry speculated such customers might include property portals (such as Rightmove, Prime Location, and MousePrice), business-to-business publications (such as Hometrack) and nationwide property consultancies (such as Savilles). Attempts by the author to interview one such potential customer (Rightmove) were unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="text">The same business case document asserts that, across all the trading funds considered, it would be existing customers of the data that would capture a significant proportion of the initial benefit of releasing the data for free. This notwithstanding, when asked to identify stakeholders who were against the release of the Price Paid Dataset as open data, Lynne Nicholson, Head of Data Products and Services at HMLR, pointed to concerns from existing commercial customers “that opening up the data would allow more competition into the market”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-030">28</a></span></span>.  </p>
<p class="text">Indeed, the response to a consultation on government open data strategy put forward by the Cabinet Office in 2011, includes one from Landmark Information Group (who own Mouseprice.com). It argues strongly in favour of a presumption for open data, but notes that:</p>
<p class="e-quote">Due consideration should be made of the private sector organisations who may already offer services around any data sets which currently attract a charge from the public sector data providers which may be candidates for being re-designated as ‘open’. Thus avoiding any potential negative affects to the existing markets.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="land_registry.html#footnote-029">29</a></span></span></p>
